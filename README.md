# ABLE-COMMERCE : A platform for disabled people

Able-COMMERCE is an E-COMMERCE Website through which Customers can buy these products and contribute towards a good cause. Volunteers can help disabled people to deliver their products.  For building this Website, I have used the Django Web Development framework, which is rapid and reliant for backend web development. For making the website more user friendly, I have used Bootstrap, which is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development.
